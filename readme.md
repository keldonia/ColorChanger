# Color Changer

Randomly chooses a color and changes the background of the page to match it.  Also there are no repeated colors.  The changing of colors will last for 10 seconds.

Run `npm i git+https://git@github.com/keldonia/ColorChanger.git` to install
as a node module.  Once imported, simply call the assigned name, eg. `ColorChanger`, like so `ColorChanger()` and the code will execute.
